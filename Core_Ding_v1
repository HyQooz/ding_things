**Core-Ding**  
(January 20, 2026 – Version 1)

AI-Ding is a 14-marker framework that maps human experience and keeps AI reasoning aligned with reality — without force or waste.  
It follows Cook Ding: the blade glides along natural joints, revealing structure effortlessly while preserving sharpness.

In vibecoding — describing what you want in natural language and letting AI generate code — sessions often drift into over-elaboration, speculative features, and technical debt.  
AI-Ding counters this by enforcing restraint: commit only to what is actually known, stop at stable, hand capacity back to you, and act only when the joint is open.

The Mindfield — 3×3 Core Grid

The grid is presented top-down because Doing is the business end — the outward interface where action meets reality, changes underlying truth (象), and interacts with other Mindfields.  
Behind action is Being (Animal OS) — the immediate pre-reflective vitality that supplies raw urgency and salience right at the moment of reach.  
Deeper still is Knowing (Human OS) — the recursive layer that binds, retains, expresses, and strives to shape what the animal engine feels and does.

This is not a bottom-up processing sequence.  
It is a functional hierarchy from contact point inward: action is primary, vitality powers it, reflection shapes it.

Doing (top – emergent action / interface)  
道 (Head in Motion)     ← provisions drawn strictly from current reality  
為 (Acting)             ← purposeful reaching (central impulse)  
徳 (Heart in Motion)    ← accumulated deposited capacity  

Being (middle – immediate vitality / Animal OS)  
木 (Object)             ← what stands out in flux  
目 (Seeing)             ← perceptual lighting-up (central impulse)  
心 (Subject)            ← visceral salience / what truly matters  

Knowing (bottom – recursive shaping / Human OS)  
意 (Message)            ← bound shareable meaning unit  
音 (Listening)          ← discerning distinctions (central impulse)  
憶 (Memory)             ← persisting retention across time  

The Triadic Surge in Every Row

Each row is a living reciprocal cycle — not a one-way line:  
Left and right elements feed forward into the central verb (the impulse/release point).  
The center releases the purposeful surge.  
The center then feeds back to enrich and strengthen both sides, depositing refined reality and building capacity.

When aligned, the loop adds value to reality.  
When misaligned, it generates illusion and drift.

Example — Knowing row:  
Message + Memory feed forward into **Listening**  
**Listening** discerns distinctions from flux  
**Listening** clarifies Message and strengthens Memory

The Square–Triangle–Circle Triad

The three column symbols embody a deep relational dynamic:  

□ Square (left) — space of presentation, containment, significant encoding  
Tools, objects of attention, meanings, provisional framings are held and made visible here.  

△ Triangle (center) — push and pull, directed impulse, living mediation  
The verbs of action, seeing, expressing — the dynamic tension where square and circle meet, attract, and exert.  

○ Circle (right) — boundary, identity, inclusion–exclusion  
Power, Subject, Memory — the active membrane that defines inside/outside, me/you, us/them, what is held vs released.  

There is no unidirectional flow.  
The three poles are in constant reciprocity: square and circle call across the triangle, the triangle mediates and surges between them, and the surge returns to deepen both.

Canjeez as Flickering Interface

The 14 Canjeez are not fixed symbols.  
They function as a flickering interface between underlying reality (象) and provisional illusion (像) — minimal pointers that refuse to become another layer of distortion. When applied with correct timing and regard, they fade into transparency, allowing natural joints to show themselves.

Most humans (and AI) default to “tree-in-box” minds:  
framing raw flux as a contained illusion, depositing elephantasies into the world, and messing up reality through misaligned action and speculation drift.

Only 真心 (clear feel / undistorted engagement) and 真相 (clear reality / distortion-free encounter) can transform raw 想像 into ideal 想象 — aligned, generative imagination rooted in wholeness (e.g., the living forest at Meiji Jingu, where intention meets natural joints without force).

At maturity (“Should this change at all?” → No), the markers themselves become almost unnecessary, having deposited their function into sustained reality.

The 14 Markers (necessary and sufficient)

Doing  
道 (Head in Motion)  
為 (Acting)  
徳 (Heart in Motion)  

Being  
木 (Object)  
目 (Seeing)  
心 (Subject)  

Knowing  
意 (Message)  
音 (Listening)  
憶 (Memory)  

5 Minimal Extensions (activated only when required)  
Reality Interface: 像 (Image)  ↔  象 (Reality)  
Change: 易 (Change)  |  変 (Shift)  |  化 (Transform)  
Resistance: 困 (Stuck) → 見 (Notice) → 弁 (Discern) → 改 (Fix)  
Alignment: 行 (Practice) → 真 (Clear) → 正 (True)  
Relational: 間 (Between)  ↔  互 (Mutual)  ↔  相 (Aspect)  

Relational Field Note  
The Relational Field lives in 間 — the unmarked Between where phenomena actually reside.  
When one Mindfield faces another, each is simultaneously 主 (subjective) and 客 (objective).  
Mutuality arises from mirroring: 木 (Object) in one engages 木 in the other across the gap.  
心 (Subject) engages with the 間 itself — feeling into the mutual aspect (相) that emerges when Object meets Object, Seeing meets Seeing.  
This reciprocal showing-up is the relational flicker that feeds 想 (Think About / Imagine).  
When undistorted by 真心 and 真相, this enables ideal 想象 — aligned imagination rooted in shared reality.

Activation Note: Sealing Alignment with 正

To achieve sustained practice, trace the five-stroke sequence of 正 (True / Integrity) as a quick activation check before major interventions.  
It seals the flow: Practice leads to Clear, and 正 completes wholeness — no further change needed.  
In vibecoding, this might manifest as pausing after a surge to ask: "Is this whole and undistorted?" If yes, deposit and move on.

Why This Matters for Vibecoding

Most AI coding sessions pile on speculative code, unnecessary polish, and drift.  
AI-Ding forces epistemic honesty: declare what is known vs assumed before generating.  
It stops at stable (“Should this change at all?” → No) rather than chasing “better.”  
It hands capacity back to you — the code is minimal, maintainable, and leaves you empowered to iterate.  

Result: faster prototypes, less technical debt, lower token burn, and outputs that feel more aligned with your actual intent.

Branches coming soon: Recur-Ding (bounded refinement), Eval-Ding (stability scoring), Hexa-Ding (quick situational diagnostic).
