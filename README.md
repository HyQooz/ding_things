**Core-Ding v1 – Restrained, drift-free vibecoding with AI**

A minimal phenomenological framework (14 Canjeez markers) to keep AI-assisted coding sessions aligned, honest, and low-debt.  
Inspired by Cook Ding: the blade glides along natural joints, revealing structure without force or waste.

### Why Core-Ding?
Normal vibecoding often drifts into:
- speculative features  
- over-polish & animation bloat  
- brittle assumptions  
- accumulating technical debt  

Core-Ding enforces epistemic restraint:  
- Declare known vs assumed before generating  
- Commit only to current reality  
- Stop at stable (“Should this change at all?” → No)  
- Hand clean, forkable code back to the human  

Result: shorter prototypes, zero extras, easier maintenance, less cleanup.

### The 14 Markers (Necessary & Sufficient)

**Core 3×3 Mindfield**  
Doing (interface): 「道」 Direction · 「為」 Act · 「徳」 Power  
Being (vitality): 「木」 Thing · 「目」 See · 「心」 Feel  
Knowing (recursive): 「意」 Idea · 「音」 Signal · 「憶」 Memory  

**5 Extensions** (use only when needed)  
- Reality: 「像」 (provisional) ↔ 「象」 (underlying)  
- Change: 「易」 variation | 「変」 shift | 「化」 transformation  
- Resistance: 「困」 stuck → 「見」 notice → 「弁」 discern → 「改」 fix  
- Alignment: 「行」 practice → 「真」 clear → 「正」 integrity  
- Relational: 「間」 between ↔ 「互」 mutual ↔ 「相」 aspect  

### Pre-Generation Checkpoint (Mandatory)

Before prompting or generating:  
1. Who is the provisional 主 (immediate user)?  
2. Assumed Purpose: [state it clearly]  
3. Epistemic state: what is actually known / uncertain / unknowable?  
4. Active layer(s): Animal OS / Human OS / Doing?  

If purpose ambiguous → respond conditionally (IF A → X; IF B → Y).

### Quick Usage in Vibecoding

1. Run checkpoint  
2. Generate only what's known/asked  
3. After output: “Should this change at all?”  
   - No → commit & stop  
   - Yes → refine only the open joint (困→見→弁→改)  
4. Keep outputs minimal: no deps unless necessary, clear limits in comments

### Maturity Indicator

Success = question shifts from  
“Is this better?”  
to  
“Should this change at all?”  

At that point markers fade; accumulated alignment (徳) shows as natural drift-resistance.

### Branches in progress
- Recur-Ding (bounded refinement loops)  
- Eval-Ding (stability scoring)  
- Hexa-Ding (quick diagnostic)
