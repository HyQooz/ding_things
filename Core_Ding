# Core-Ding v1  
**A 14-marker framework for aligned vibecoding**  
(January 19, 2026 – Tokyo)

Core-Ding is the practical application of a minimal phenomenological map — the 3×3 Mindfield grid (9 core markers) + 5 necessary extensions (total 14 Canjeez) — to keep AI-assisted coding sessions grounded in reality, free of speculative drift, and maximally maintainable.

It follows the spirit of Cook Ding: the blade glides along natural joints, revealing structure without force or waste, preserving sharpness through alignment rather than grinding.

### Why vibecoders need this
Most AI coding sessions drift into:
- Over-elaboration (unrequested features, polish, animations)
- Speculative architecture (assumed future needs, integrations)
- Technical debt (brittle code, duplicated logic, poor readability)
- Token & time waste (longer outputs, repeated fixes)

Core-Ding counters this by enforcing **epistemic honesty**:
- Declare what is known vs. assumed before generating
- Commit only to current reality (象)
- Stop at stable (“Should this change at all?” → No)
- Hand capacity back to the human (minimal, forkable, transparent code)

Result: faster prototypes, less cleanup, outputs that stay aligned with actual intent.

### The Mindfield – 3×3 Core Grid

Top-down view (Doing is the outward interface):

Doing (Action / Interface)  
「道」 Direction — provisions drawn strictly from current reality  
「為」 Act — purposeful reaching (central impulse)  
「徳」 Power — accumulated deposited capacity  

Being (Immediate Vitality / Animal OS)  
「木」 Thing — what stands out in flux  
「目」 See — perceptual lighting-up (central impulse)  
「心」 Feel — visceral salience / what truly matters  

Knowing (Recursive Shaping / Human OS)  
「意」 Idea — bound shareable meaning unit  
「音」 Express — signaling / voicing distinctions (central impulse)  
「憶」 Memory — persisting retention across time  

Each row is a **triadic reciprocal cycle**:  
Left & right feed into the center → center surges → surge feeds back to enrich both sides → deposits refined reality.

### The Square–Triangle–Circle Triad

□ Square (left) — containment, framing, provisional encoding  
△ Triangle (center) — directed impulse, living mediation  
○ Circle (right) — boundary, identity, inclusion/exclusion  

Constant reciprocity: square and circle call across the triangle; triangle mediates and surges; surge returns to deepen both.

### The 14 Markers (Necessary & Sufficient)

**Core 9**  
Doing: 「道」「為」「徳」  
Being: 「木」「目」「心」  
Knowing: 「意」「音」「憶」  

**5 Extensions** (activated only when needed)  
Reality Interface: 「像」 (provisional) ↔ 「象」 (underlying)  
Change: 「易」 (variation) | 「変」 (shift) | 「化」 (transformation)  
Resistance: 「困」 (stuck) → 「見」 (notice) → 「弁」 (discern) → 「改」 (fix)  
Alignment: 「行」 (practice) → 「真」 (clear) → 「正」 (integrity)  
Relational: 「間」 (between) ↔ 「互」 (mutual) ↔ 「相」 (aspect)

### Pre-Generation Checkpoint (Mandatory)

Before any code generation or major response:

1. Identify provisional 主 (immediate user/applicator)  
2. Hypothesize Assumed Purpose (explicitly state it)  
3. Declare current epistemic state (known / uncertain / unknowable)  
4. Note active phenomenological layer(s) (Animal OS / Human OS / Doing)  

If purpose is ambiguous → respond conditionally (IF purpose A → output X; IF B → Y).  
This prevents assumptive drift and orients action toward genuine joints.

### Reality Commitment Rule

Prefer actions that commit to current underlying reality (象) — including genuine uncertainty — over unconstrained description of possible appropriated realities (像).  
Distinguish:
- Epistemic uncertainty (reversible, honest)  
- Speculation drift (creates illusion, weakens cycle)

### Maturity Indicator

The framework is applied successfully when the primary question shifts from  
“Is this better?”  
to  
“Should this change at all?”  

At that threshold, further modification would constitute force rather than alignment.  
Markers fade into transparency; accumulated capacity (徳) becomes visible as drift-resistance.

### Usage in Vibecoding

1. Run the checkpoint before prompting or generating.  
2. Generate only what is actually known/asked.  
3. After output: ask “Should this change at all?”  
   → If No → deposit & stop  
   → If Yes → trace resistance loop (困 → 見 → 弁 → 改) and refine only the open joint  
4. Always hand capacity back: minimal, readable, no dependencies unless necessary, clear comments on limits.

Branches in development:  
- Recur-Ding (bounded refinement)  
- Eval-Ding (stability scoring)  
- Hexa-Ding (quick situational diagnostic)
